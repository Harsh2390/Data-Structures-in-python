# Data-Structures-in-python
"Explore the World of Data Structures with Python - A Comprehensive Repository"

## Project Description
'This repository is dedicated to the implementation of fundamental data structures in Python. It aims to provide clear, efficient and tested code examples for structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. This project serves as a resource for students, educators, and professionals looking to deepen their understanding of data structures and their applications in Python.'

## Installation
To use these implementations, first clone the repository to your local machine: <br />
git clone https://github.com/Harsh2390/Data-Structures-in-python.git <br />
cd python-data-structures

"Ensure you have Python installed on your system. No additional libraries are required for the basic data structure implementations."

## Usage
Each data structure is implemented in its separate module. To use a data structure in your code, simply import the respective class from the module. For example, to use the LinkedList class:

```python
from linked_list import LinkedList

# Create a new LinkedList
my_list = LinkedList()
my_list.append(1)
my_list.append(2)
my_list.display()
